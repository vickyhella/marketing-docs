00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,679
installing harvester is a very easy task

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,759
you just need to download and install the iso we provide 

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,320
we will create a new cluster

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,280
then we will select the disk

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,559
we will provide the network configuration

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,119
including the host name

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,080
the management network interface

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,039
the dns server

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,840
and the custom token this token will be
used to secure your harvester deployment

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
we need to provide the password to
access to nodes

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,879
as well as the ntp configuration 

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,559
please note that ntp is critical for a
successful harvester installation

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,760
after you verify the provide parameters

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
you are ready to install harvester

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,800
it will perform some automatic tasks

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,840
and after a few minutes
your harvester installation
will be ready
