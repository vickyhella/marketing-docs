many assume their cloud provider or other supplemental technologies will cover everything needed for kubernetes security

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,439
but they don't

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,599
with kubernetes being open source and notoriously hard to implement and understand

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,840
you can be left blind to what's happening in your network

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,719

to identify flaws throughout the application life cycle

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,120
automated behavioral learning to discover container processes inspect and validate network traffic

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,440
generate security policy as code

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,159
and enable virtual patching to prevent attacks

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,880
network security to prevent malware or attackers from traversing the entire network

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,200
including real-time blocking of zero day threats

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,479
and deep packet inspection for layer 7 visibility of all kubernetes defined and undefined network traffic

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:31,040
and compliance, the only solution to meet specific data security and network segmentation requirements for pci dss soc 2 and gdpr
