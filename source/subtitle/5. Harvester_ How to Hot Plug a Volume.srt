hi the courser here

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:10,400
i want to show how to add a disk to a running vm on harvester

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:19,520
this comes after a demo i did during the cube versus summit 2022 and during the demo i did one error

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,039
i went to the config here on volumes

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,119
and i tried to add an existing volume

6
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,239
then unchecked restart now and click save so

7
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
if i do it actually just to show you what is the error

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
here i will pick my cuber submit disk

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,200
and everything else is set up for me

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
and then when i will click save it gave me the error

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
and i thought it was like the demo gods against me well

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,039
no what i did wrong is that i need to add a volume directly from the menu here

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:09,600
where i will call it cube vert summit disk for example

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
and then i will pick up my disk that is unassigned

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
I will click apply

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,759
and if i go to the volumes now i can see that it's attached to the vm

17
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
so back to the vm now

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
what we will see here for now is i don't have the disk so

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,520
if i refresh the settings here now it sees the disk

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,479
and if i go to the disk manager and i refresh also

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,320
i will have a new disk appearing in few seconds

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,799
and actually it's here sorry

23
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,399
and here i can see my 10 gigabit uh disk so

24
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
if i put it online

25
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,720
i initialized it with gpt

26
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,800
and finally i can create a volume out of it with the full space

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,760
i will just keep the defaults for the demo

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,360
and now we can see the disk so here it is how to add odd plug volume
