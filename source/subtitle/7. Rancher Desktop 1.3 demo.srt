00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,920
hello welcome to a new release of rancher desktop

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,080
but what is rancher desktop rancher's desktop is a nice piece of software 

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,960
that provides you a local environment to develop containers and workloads 

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,960
that runs on mac on windows and linux 

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,599
it offers you container management 

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,760
you can build push and pull your images 

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
it offers you a local kubernetes where you can test your microservices and workloads 

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:42,160
it is built on projects like K3s and containerd

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,559
today we're going to cover Rancher Desktop 1.3

10
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,160
as you can see the basic UI didn't change much

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,120
version 1.3.0 so let's overview the ui

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,720
in this part here nothing or not much change

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,640
but there are news you're going to see all the new stuff coming

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,840
so at the moment let's check the images in the cluster already deployed

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,360
so we can see that basically are the images that K3s used to work

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,560
but now let's take a look how we can pull an image from Rancher Desktop

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,400
let's pull a BCI image

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,960
so as you see you paste the URL

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,200
you pull the image

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
but you can do much more than that

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,320
we find the image there

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
we can push it to a registry 

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
or we can scan for CVEs 

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,040
as BCI is a very secure image, we won't find any CVE

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
that's cool let's keep going

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,440
so we can configure the kubernetes as we saw, we selected containerd 

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,360
so we need to use nerdctl, let's make a test 

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
let's run an alpine image

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,440
and let's connect to the container 

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,319
and perform a basic ls command

31
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,920
and after this

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,720
we will see that however we were working on the cli

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:43,760
we'll see the image in the namespace default in the Rancher Desktop UI

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,560
so again we are scanning for vulnerabilities

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,599
looks like everything is in place

36
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
perfect

37
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,000
so now let's see the shiny new dashboard yeah

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,959
now rancher desktop has a dashboard

39
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,560
a really cool one

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
if you are used to rancher

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,120
you will see something that is familiar to you 

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
so let's check what we can see and do from this dashboard

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
first of all

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
basic stuff, namespaces, nodes

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,120
so it's a development environment, one node

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
control plane and also worker

47
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
we can see the information 

48
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
we can see what is going on on that node

49
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,000
we can see a huge amount of information

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,040
DaemonSets, deployments in the cluster

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
we can see jobs, StatefulSet, Pods

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
we can click delete something 

53
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
we can redeploy

54
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,480
we can interact what would be seen inside of the cluster

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
so we can check the pod

56
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
see this pod is not ready

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,599
we can move on to another pod

58
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,239
so for instance the load balancer, traffic

59
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,519
so we can from here execute a shell

60
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560
we can connect to the pod 

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
and perform operations inside that pod 

62
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
just from this new dashboard that's very cool

63
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
i think for me it's very cool

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
it's easy and it's really intuitive

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
this is great

66
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,880
we can see related resources also 

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
we can see the services on the cluster

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
which services are deployed

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,600
which ports are using

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,440
a lot of information okay

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
but we don't stop here 

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,600
we can also create and expose services from the dashboard

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,360
so again very cool we can create our own service

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
load balancers like in this case 

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
we can create node for whatever we need

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
we can do it just from here

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,919
rancher desktop is about making your life easier

78
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,160
that's what this dashboard does 

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,039
makes your life easier

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,840
so we can see a lot of information more ip addresses

81
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,720
selectors, we can select affinity, labels

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
all what you can expect from kubernetes

83
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
but from a single and nice UI

84
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
we can see also the storage, storage classes

85
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,479
persistent volumes, ConfigMaps

86
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,280
and almost any kind of resource you can imagine

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,039
you can find it here

88
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,880
k3s resources for instance 

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,919
add-ons the helm charts that are being used inside k3s that is what we are using at the moment

90
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,400
we can access and interact with the role-based access of the cluster 

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
so you can see cluster roles, user roles

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,560
you can create, destroy, interact

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,639
again making your life easier

94
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,080
so we can see also the nodes

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,360
and the storage classes

96
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,520
among the information we can see the

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
traffic IngressRoutes

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,680
we can see what is inside

99
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
api resources services you know

100
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
with Rancher you can do anything through the API

101
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,520
that's all
