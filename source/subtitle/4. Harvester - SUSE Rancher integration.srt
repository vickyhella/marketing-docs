1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,410
harvester can also be managed from the
standard rancher console

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
you just need to navigate to the virtualization management section and

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,840
you will get a very similar experience
that the one you get when managing
harvester directly

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,359
there are just a couple of differences as you can note

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
namespaces are also referred as projects

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,880
and you can configure
rancho attack from this interface

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
as harvester is yet another provider for rancher

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,680
you can provision your own rke and rk2 clusters

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,320
you will follow the same procedure as you would do for any other provider

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,840
you can of course create your own template for your harvester deployment

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,480
please note that the options are very similar to any infrastructure provider

12
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,759
you can of course select multiples vms

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,280
and you just need to make sure you select harvester as your provider

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,880
in harvester you can also deploy your a key and your k3s clusters

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,840
you will pull all the options directly from the provider
